## Install

Pick the version you want to use (look in the branches) and run in the root of your neum source folder (defaults to your source folder):

```sh
git submodule add -b dev https://github.com/Neum-CSS/cute .neum/cute
```

Use dev for the latest version (can be breaking not recomended) or replace dev with the version you want.
