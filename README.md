## Install

Make a folder called `.neum` in the root of your neum folder (defaults to your source folder). Pick the version you want to use (look in the branches) and run: 

```sh
git submodule add -b dev https://github.com/Neum-CSS/cute .neum/cute
```

Use dev for the latest version (can be breaking not recomended) or replace dev with the version you want.
