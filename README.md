## Install

Make a folder called `.neum` in the root of your neum folder (defaults to your source folder). Pick the version you want to use (look in the branches) and run `git submodule add -b master https://github.com/Neum-CSS/cute .neum/cute`, use master for the latest version (can be breaking not recomended) or replace master with the version you want.
